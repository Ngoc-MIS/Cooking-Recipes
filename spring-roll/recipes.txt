1. Dip wrappers in water. Fill a large shallow dish or pie plate with an inch or so of water.
2. Add filling. Layer everything on the â…“ of the spring roll that is closest to you. Add 1-2 of each ingredient, and small pinch of noodles.
3. 3. Wrap. Pick up the sides of the spring roll and fold them in over the toppings. 
Then pick up the edge closest to you and pull it up and snugly over the toppings.
Continue rolling all the way up like a burrito. 
Practice will make perfect, but just try to keep all of the ingredients in tightly together as you roll everything up.
